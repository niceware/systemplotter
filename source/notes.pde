/**
 * hey! thanks for uh. looking at this I guess
 *
 * feel free to use any of this in your own projects, 
 * whether you base something on this or just use nab
 * of the classes. credit would be nice, though, so 
 * somewhere in your documentation just mention it.
 * or maybe leave a comment at the top of the code if
 * you use one of the classes. 
 *
 * think something could be better? let me know!
