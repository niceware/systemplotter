    <p>Here's some sample text here to view and all that cool fancy yay</p>
    <p>Controls:</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>green:</strong> display data, showing where the mouse is, and how many points are being rendered </li>
      <li> <strong>red:</strong> input the system of equations by each coefficient </li>
      <li> <strong>yellow:</strong> controls how precisely the points will move. ".1" works best for a blend of program speed and precision </li>
      <li> <strong>blue:</strong> if checked, lets the points move on their own </li>
      <li> <strong>cyan:</strong> while blue section is unchecked, will move the points forward a single step </li>
      <li> <strong>violet:</strong> changes point placing system between mouse click (unchecked) and mouse click-and-drag (checked) </li>
      <li> <strong>orange:</strong> remote point placing system; either place a number of random points or a single point to the typed location </li>
      <li> <strong>white:</strong> how a placed point looks on screen! notice its tail showing where it once was, and the fading tail of a now off-screen point </li>
    </ul>
